# TODO

* Get local coordinates for mouse movement in 3D viewer;
* Tuples;
* Records;
* Ensure type aliases to work, may be also display the alias name;
* Controlling some function results with inputs (some code is already in the `Cell`/`Tryings`), also: https://ellie-app.com/jF6N5Ksxta1/4);
* Plots for some functions;
* `raw` viewer for those types which are usually wrapped in 3dViewer or wrapped with inputs, if user wants to see them in their pureness instead;
* X/Y/Z vectors for 3dViewer;
* Collage viewers;
* The ability to add more screens;
* Tabs should display the condition of the code (Outdated vs Compiling vs Compiled/Up-to-date);
* Keyboard shortcuts in the interface; Ability to quickly switch Screens with some hotkey and/or number key;
* Expose only required things from all used or generated Elm modules;
* Subscribe to mouseMove only when cell is 3D;

## Long stretch goals

* Zoom, reset position and some other pretty options for 3D-viewer;
* Better error display;
* Listen for mouse movement only if Cell has 3DViewer inside;
* Consider other ways of chosing a version of new Screen (i.e. use hash numbers or milliseconds for versioning);
